# Tarumanagara Insurance - Web Application
Welcome to the Tarumanagara Insurance web application, a modern, client-side website designed to provide users with information and tools for purchasing insurance policies. This project is built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on dynamic user interfaces and local data persistence using the browser's Local Storage.

# ‚ú® Key Features
This application includes a range of features that simulate a real-world insurance purchasing experience:

User Authentication: A complete, client-side signup and login system that stores user data locally.

Dynamic UI: The navigation bar and other elements change based on the user's login status (e.g., showing "Login/Sign Up" vs. a personalized "Account" menu).

Responsive Design: Layouts for the landing page, forms, and product cards are designed to be fully responsive and work on various screen sizes.

Insurance Premium Calculators: Interactive forms for three different products (Health, Life, Car) that calculate estimated premiums based on user input.

Checkout & Purchase Flow: A simulated checkout process that allows users to "pay" for their selected policy.

Purchase History: A dedicated page that displays a list of all transactions made by the logged-in user, demonstrating data persistence across sessions.

Modular Components: The navbar and footer are loaded dynamically into each page, promoting code reusability.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project is built with fundamental web technologies, making it a great example of what can be achieved without a complex framework.

HTML5: For the structure and content of all pages.

CSS3: For all styling, including modern layouts with Flexbox, animations (like the fluid gradient background), and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all client-side logic, including:

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically creating and updating HTML content.

Local Storage: Persisting user accounts and purchase history in the browser.

Event Handling: Managing user interactions with forms, buttons, and menus.
